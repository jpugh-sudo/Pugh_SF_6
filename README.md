Perl code for CpG-DNA KIR3DL2 analysis

1. ‘CG_interdist.pl’ – finds the CpG interdistance of a genome or collection of genomes.
2. ‘Find NCBI.pl’ – using a reference file of species names, searches Medgen for a
match, creating a new list of names
3. ‘MCE_octo.pl’ Records the frequency of each of the 4096 possible CpG octamers in a
genomic dataset.
4. ‘species_select_octo.pl‘ Records the frequency of select CpG octamers for each
genome in a concatenated dataset of many genomes, in addition to the length of each
genomic record.
